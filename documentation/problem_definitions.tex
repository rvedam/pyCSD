\section{Definitions}
Let $w$ represent a word in some language $L$ (Assuming $L$ is English)\\
Let us define the following:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item{a \textbf{sentence} $s := \{w_1,w_2,...,w_n\}$} of words.
\item{a \textbf{document} $d := \{s_1,s_2,...,s_n\}$} of sentences.
\item{a \textbf{context} $\beta$ is defined as the window in which a concept or set of concepts may exist. in our problem, let $\beta := s_i$ for some sentence $s_i \in d$.}
\item{a \textbf{span}, denoted by $\alpha$, is defined as the subset of words within a given context $\beta$ for which a concept mapping(s) may exist.}
\item{a \textbf{corpus} $C := \{d_1,d_2,...,d_n\}$ of documents}
\item{a \textbf{concept} $\gamma$ is a concept (represented in this case as a UMLS Concept CUI) that best describes the meaning of a given span $\alpha$}
\item{Given a corpus $C$ and a context $\beta$, we define the \textbf{meaning utility} of a word as a function $M: (\gamma,\alpha) \rightarrow n$ where n is nonnegative number representing the usefulness for a span $\alpha$ given a particular concept}
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem Description}
Given a corpus $C$ of documents, for any given span $\alpha_i \in \beta$ for a given context $\beta$ for which there exists one or more $\gamma$ that describe $\alpha_i$, we are to find the $(\gamma,\alpha_i)$ pair that satisifies:\\[1mm]
\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
\arg\max_{(\gamma, \alpha_i)}(M(\gamma,\alpha_i))
\end{equation}
